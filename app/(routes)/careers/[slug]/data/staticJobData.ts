    content: `As an Aircraft Maintenance Technician, you will be responsible for performing scheduled maintenance, inspections, and unscheduled repairs on a variety of aircraft. You will work closely with our logistics and quality assurance teams to ensure all work is completed to the highest standards of safety and compliance.

In this role you will diagnose complex mechanical and avionics issues, execute corrective actions, and document every step thoroughly. You'll participate in root-cause investigations for recurring faults, contribute to continuous-improvement initiatives, and help maintain inventory accuracy by coordinating closely with the parts and procurement teams. The position requires hands-on troubleshooting, a methodical approach to maintenance tasks, and adherence to DGCA and company quality management procedures.

We value technicians who bring technical curiosity and ownership — you'll have opportunities for cross-training on different aircraft types and to mentor junior staff. Your work will directly support operational availability and safety, so strong communication, a proactive mindset, and a commitment to zero-compromise safety culture are essential.

This is a site-based, full-time role located in Bengaluru; occasional extended hours or on-call duties may be required during aircraft turns or special maintenance events.`,
